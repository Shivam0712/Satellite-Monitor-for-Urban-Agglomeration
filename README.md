# Satellite-Monitor-for-Urban-Agglomeration

## What is this monitor all about?
The monitor will comprise of a machine learning(CNN) model at core which will take night light images thumbnail as input and output whether the place is urban or not.

## What are its feature?
The sytem will identify urban places and will keep record of its co-ordinates:
1. It will keep augmenting itself and keep adding new coordinates which it identifies as to be urban.
2. for the existing urban places it will identify the growth of these agglomerations and keep augmenting the boundaries.
3. It will monitor the intensity of night light in these centres and will create a time series analysis.

## How this will work?
A CNN model will be the core of this model.
